how do youu do smoke test for login page which has username , password, ok, and cancel buttons.

Smoke Testing is a positive test & so there should be
following 2 test cases:
1. It should checks that user is able to login with valid
credentials.
2. User should remain on the login page & any data entered
by the user is removed when he clicks on Cancel button.


git stash
git pull origin main
git stash pop
git add .
